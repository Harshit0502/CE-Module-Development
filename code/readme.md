## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

**code_definitions**:
  analyze_ss_movingload.py:
    analyze_beam:
      description: >
        Orchestrates the full analysis. Initializes influence line object,
        computes shear force and bending moment envelopes, and returns max values.

 ## ðŸ“Œ influence_line.py:

   ** InfluenceLine1**:
      description: Initializes the influence line model for a simply supported beam.
      methods:
